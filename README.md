# BN-Complexity-Experiment
 main.py addresses the function frequency and output complexity questions 
'constant' experiment intends to illustrate the interesting relation between the Lempel Ziv Complexity of a sequence and its subsequence
the 
Loss-LVC plot.py plots mean complexity for two networks resectively w.r.t training epocs
